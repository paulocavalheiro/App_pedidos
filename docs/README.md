## Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command **from inside this `docs` folder** (where `docs.json` is located):

```bash
cd docs
mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Important:** For this project, always run `mint dev` from the **docs** folder, not from the project root. Running from the root can cause "module is not defined" or "exports is not defined" errors because Mintlify would try to bundle backend and frontend code.

## Publishing changes

Install our GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) to propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes are deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

### Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `mint update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json`.
